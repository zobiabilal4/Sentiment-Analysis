## EXPLORING THE POWER OF SENTIMENT ANALYSIS: Transforming Amazon Reviews to Improve Customer Satisfaction and Make Informed Decisions

# Overview
- Machine learning project
- Sentimental analysis based on customer reviews
- Classification model
- Goal: Determine sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral

# Problem Statement
In the realm of Amazon's e-commerce platform, managing the influx of product reviews poses a challenge. This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model tailored for Amazon reviews. Its goal is to accurately classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, empowering sellers with actionable insights.Challenges include diverse product categories and varying review lengths. Success will enable informed decision-making and enhanced customer satisfaction.

# Methdology
We will generate our own dataset by applying the technique of web scraping on Amazon. For that purpose we will use Selenium. For text classification, we will take the help of TextBlob or any suitable platform.

# Dataset Features
- P_name :Product Name (Type:String)
- P_des : Product Description (Type:String)
- P_price : Product Price (Type:Int)
- P_availability : Product Instock / Outstock (Type:String)
- R_username :Reviewr Username (Type:String)
- P_review : Product Review (Type:String)
- P_rating : Product Rating (Type:Int)
- Sentiment : Classify user-generated reviews into categories such as positive, negative, neutral (Type:String)

# Business Scope
Our project involves designing a robust model that generalizes well across
different product categories, mitigating biases, and addressing potential
challenges such as varying review lengths and language nuances. The
successful implementation of this sentiment analysis model will empower
businesses to make data-driven decisions based on a comprehensive
understanding of customer sentiments expressed in online product reviews.
Moreover our model adds a powerful visualization to the product purchase.
We can get idea about the purchasing impact of the products also.
