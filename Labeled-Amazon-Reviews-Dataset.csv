I tried it allover based on many stellar review pics stating they did, but am sad to report I had less stunning results. It's an extremely lightweight, but even coverage (fantastic) tinted moisturizer. It does give you a vaguely dewy look, but when you use it all over your face it looses some of that luster. This seems to mean that people in the reviews had other undisclosed makeup on in the pic (especially anyone with rosy cheeks! That had to be blush. It wasn't this) OR used their true shade + one darker to contour, as suggested as 1 of 3 ways to use it on the bottle, to make targeted highlighting and contrast. Either way, it's still a fantastic product if you want a dewy highlighter or dewy tinted moisturizer, just don't expect to look like most of the review pics unless you layer it with other makeup. I don't typically wear makeup, so I'm not looking to add contouring and/blush to the regimen.

Seriously takes keeping HOT... hot, and keeping COLD... cold. I bought the large tumbler with straw due to my liking the straw feature however, you can take the straw off and just do the sipping, as with coffee. Slender bottom allows you to place your mug inside your vehicle cup holder. Flat base of mug is slippage proof, yet if you knock it hard enough it shall tumble. I LOVE the fact that it can be cleaned in the Dish Washer. Many of these Thermos Tumblers tell you NO dishwasher, yet this one comes out sanitized and does not lose it's color. I am a person who will drink half of whatever I have in the Thermos, put it down and come back to it later... sometimes hours later, and I honestly I like having what I left in the Thermos... either warm, or very cold. When I mean warm, I mean as if I just microwaved it for 30 seconds. I also love the top handle. I can put it on my belt, or bike, or cart if needed.

Coming in service for four with a dinner plate, salad, plate, and two different types of bowls, you’ll be set with all the pieces needed for any meal. The convenience is complimented by the intricacy of design that goes into making this plate; a reactive glaze with beautiful embossed tones throughout the dishes will make you fall in love with these dishes when setting  your table. These are the perfect centerpiece to any dining experience.",Home & Kitchen,4.6,"I recently invested in the 16-piece double bowl set, and while there's much to love, there are a couple of aspects I'd like to highlight for potential buyers. Here's what stood out to me:

What I Love:

Chic Aesthetics: The embossed design and the light blue interior paired with the cream exterior give these plates/bowls a sophisticated and stylish appearance. They truly elevate the presentation of meals and make any dining occasion special.

Versatile Bowl Sizes: The inclusion of both cereal bowls and salad/pasta bowls is a practical choice. The larger salad/pasta bowls are perfect for substantial servings, while the cereal bowls are great for a variety of breakfast options. The versatility in bowl sizes has proven to be a convenient feature.

Considerations:

Weightier Than Expected: One thing to note is that these bowls are a bit heavier than they appear in the pictures. While this adds to their durability, it's worth mentioning for those who prefer lighter tableware.

Deep Cereal Bowls: The cereal bowls are notably deep, which may be a personal preference. While some may appreciate the extra capacity, others might find it a bit deeper than expected for standard cereal portions.

Despite these considerations, I find the set to be an excellent addition to my kitchen. The weightiness speaks to the quality of the ceramics used, and the deep cereal bowls are a unique feature for those who prefer heartier breakfasts. Overall, this 16-piece double bowl set combines style and functionality, making it a solid choice for anyone looking to enhance their tableware collection.

The only drawback I've encountered is a minor color discrepancy. While the light blue and cream combination is beautiful, the Amazon picture appears to show an aquamarine shade, which I was initially hoping for. It's a subtle difference, but worth noting for those who are particular about color coordination.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2023",positive

I love the two bowl sizes and the two plate sizes with no mugs. I have so many mugs already that the thought of adding more made me say no to a lot of set. All of the sizes are just what I was looking for.

On the positive side, a dry foundation can provide a matte finish, which is great for people with oily skin as it helps to control shine throughout the day. It also tends to have a lightweight feel, making it more comfortable to wear for long periods of time.

However, there are also some downsides to a dry foundation. One major issue is that it can emphasize dry patches and flaky skin, making your complexion look uneven and patchy. This can be particularly problematic for individuals with dry or dehydrated skin. Additionally, a dry foundation may not offer as much coverage as a liquid or cream foundation, so if you have blemishes or imperfections that you want to hide, it may not be the best option.

In terms of application, a dry foundation typically requires a bit more effort to blend into the skin. It may not spread as easily or evenly as a liquid or cream foundation, so it's important to take your time and ensure that it is properly blended for a seamless finish.

Overall, whether or not a dry foundation is suitable for you will depend on your skin type and personal preferences. If you have oily skin and prefer a matte finish, a dry foundation may be a good fit for you. However, if you have dry or dehydrated skin, or if you're looking for more coverage, you may want to consider a different type of foundation.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2024",neutral

Two tips using any powder foundation: if you find the powder foundation gets cakey or dry looking spray your face with either mineral water or any other face spray. I use Mario Badescu rose water. This cuts down that dry flat look. Second tip if you smash your foundation smash it more so that you get a fine powder then add a couple of drops of alcohol. You can use isopropyl, vodka or even eau de cologne. Mix thoroughly with a lollipop stick until you get a smooth paste. Press back into the container and smooth as well as you can.

Let's start with its effectiveness as a makeup remover. This balm melts away even the toughest waterproof makeup effortlessly, leaving my skin feeling clean and refreshed.

Plus, the added infusion of hyaluronic acid provides an extra boost of hydration, leaving my skin feeling soft and supple after each use.

Like, a single use of charcoal face wash made my entire face peel and get scaly for way too long. My face blistered when using a new (""gentle"") moisturizer. So she gets mad for no reason, all the time.

I do however wear the longest-lasting eyeliner and the stickiest mascara in existence when I do convince myself to wear it, and it's REALLY hard to get off. I used one of those makeup eraser towels, which are nice, but I would basically have to lay it over my eyes forever with steaming water to make my makeup budge. I've used other makeup removers that make my face feel like it's burning (looking at you, Neutrogena), so I've been really hesitant to try new things.

I took a risk on this stuff, and it totally paid off. It MELTS even the most stubborn makeup off. I just put it on my fingers, rub it in circles, and it just... comes right off. Depending on what I'm wearing, I sometimes have to wipe the dirty balm off of my face and repeat. I've never had to do that more than twice, though.

It smells so good, it feels nice on the skin, and it doesn't dry me out or... you know, give me face blisters. All these things are a plus. It does the job, it does it gently, and it does it easily. I always rinse/wash my face after I use it, so I'm not sure how it feels if you were to just wipe it off and leave remnants, but do you.

Gentle Formula: I have sensitive skin, and I'm happy to report that this cleansing balm is gentle yet effective. It doesn't irritate or strip my skin, making it suitable for daily use.

Luxurious Texture: The balm has a luxurious, silky texture that glides smoothly onto the skin, making the cleansing process feel like a spa-like experience.

Affordable Price: Considering the quality and performance of this product, the price point is unbeatable. It's an affordable option that delivers exceptional results.
Cons:

None: Honestly, I can't think of any downsides to this product. It exceeded my expectations in every way, and I will definitely be repurchasing it in the future.

with a 38 chest and a 29 waist, these shirts fit surprisingly perfect.
However, if you are looking for thin, stretchy, athletic shirts, these wont be it. They have a thick and sharp look, but are still quite comfortable.

Now I must be clear and tell you that they indeed shrink quite a bit after tumble drying, but that is expected from 100% cotton. With my thin frame being as tall as I am, the shirts are flattering and snug at the chest and arms the way I want, but are still quite short in length.

If you don't tuck in your shirts the way I do, go with the large. I went for medium mostly for the chest fit and because the length is irrelevant to me since I tuck in everything I wear.

Overall highly recommend not just because they fit so well for a skinny tall guy, but the price was hard to steer away from. Amazon Essentials impressed me again.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2022",positive

Amazon Basics Woodcased #2 Pencils, Pre-sharpened, HB Lead - Box of 150, Bulk Box
From the Manufacturer
Amazon Basics",Office Products,4.8,"I recently purchased the Amazon Basics Woodcased #2 Pencils for my kids’ school supplies, and I have to say, they are fantastic! This bulk box of pre-sharpened pencils has been a lifesaver for keeping my kids stocked up on writing utensils for their schoolwork.

First and foremost, the quality of these pencils is excellent. The HB lead provides a smooth and consistent writing experience, making it easy for my kids to complete their assignments neatly and accurately. Plus, the pre-sharpened tips save time and hassle, ensuring that they can start writing right away without having to search for a sharpener.

The bulk box of 150 pencils is incredibly convenient, providing more than enough pencils to last my kids throughout the school year. It’s also great for keeping extras on hand for when they inevitably misplace or break a pencil.

I appreciate the classic yellow design of the pencils, which is not only timeless but also easy to spot in their pencil cases or desks. The hexagonal shape of the pencils provides a comfortable grip for writing, reducing hand fatigue during long writing sessions.

Overall, I couldn’t be happier with the Amazon Basics Woodcased #2 Pencils. They are a reliable and cost-effective option for school supplies, and I highly recommend them to any parent looking to stock up on pencils for their kids’ schoolwork.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2024",positive

Amazon Basics",Office Products,4.8,"At the end of the school year, I always buy a pack of pencils to replenish my depleted stock. (I teach 7th and 8th grade English). Last year, I bought 144 golf pencils for about $8. It was a great investment, because a lot of times, I have kids who ALWAYS forget a pencil. They aren’t the ones who necessarily need a pencil, because more often than not, they would lose the pencil again before they made a mistake. However, despite having 144 of them, I ran out in late April, with about two months still left in the school year. I will buy another pack of those golf pencils for the students who perpetually borrow a pencil, but I quickly learned that every so often, I had a student who really needed a pencil, but wasn’t someone who made a habit of bringing nothing to class. Likewise, these were students were the ones who didn’t need it for a few periods, but truly needed a new pencil for them to keep for weeks. Unfortunately, I didn't have any “real” pencils, and when I saw these AmazonBasic pencils on sale (96 for about $6 – regularly they’re less than $8), I knew I needed these as well.

I’m actually really picky about my own personal pencils. I have a favorite brand, and I have a favorite brand of erasers to put on them. Nevertheless, I was really excited to try out these pencils because although they didn't have the price tag of a Dixon-Ticonderoga, they still worked really well.

QUALITY:

These are just your every day, basic pencils, but that’s how I like mine. I hate pencils with that plastic film with a design printed on them. With “cute” pencils, you aren’t paying for the pencil, you’re paying for whatever logo is on it (like Frozen or Star Wars). When you sharpen those ones for the first time, the film splits and then the cute design ends up peeling off. However, these AmazonBasics pencils were easy to sharpen, and they were nice to write with. Sometimes, pencils are prone to have the graphite split so there is a strange press on the paper, resulting in “double” writing. I wrote for a bit with the pencil and even as it dulled, it still wrote nicely. You can note a small letter I wrote to test it; it is the third image.

ERASER:

Another thing I hate about cheap pencils is the garbage erasers. As a teacher, I write most things in pen, but I always do my grade book in pencil. If a student turns in something late, I need to erase the previous grade to change it, and I can’t stand having left over marks from a bad eraser. Now, as I mentioned, I have one specific brand of erasers which are honestly God’s gift to humanity, and I always slap one of those bad boys on my pencils, but this really wasn’t bad as far as erasers go. I mean, it was still obvious that I made a mistake, but I also press into the paper like I’m trying to cut a hole into the table underneath. I write DARK. I have many students who press lightly. As well, if I were drawing, I would draw lighter. In the third picture attached to this review, there are two instances of erasing. The first is over “film” in fourth line in the first paragraph. The other is the second paragraph, titled “Eraser test.” As I mentioned, I write so dark that it’s difficult to erase to the point where it doesn’t appear that there was a mistake at all, but I also think your average person wouldn’t mind. I can clearly make out what is written over the erased bits, and no annoying parts of the eraser were left behind (like a giant pink smudge… Ugh, I hate that the most).

SMUDGE TEST:

Speaking of smudges, I don’t frequently smudge my pencil work because I’m right handed. However, I have left handed students who turn in work that is barely legible because they drag their hand throughout their writing constantly. Thinking of them, I wanted to test out how badly the graphite smudged on a hand. The results are the fourth picture. Now, this wasn’t just me carefully dragging my hand over the paper; I really pressed, TRYING to smudge the words. And yeah, I did smudge it a bit, and yeah, I did get some graphite on my hand. However, this is NOTHING compared to some of the other pencils I’ve seen. As you can see from my hand, it was minor, considering I was literally pressing hard on the paper, trying to get the graphite on my hand.

OVERALL:

The bottom line is that a 12 pack of any type of pencils can go for over $2. In fact, a lot of times the “cute” pencils are the most expensive, but they’re the worst as far as quality. If looks aren’t a thing you care about, but do care about quality, these are the best deal. A 96 pack of Ticonderoga pencils can range from $14-$20 (depending on packaging and color and where you’re buying them). I always use Ticonderogas as the standard for the perfect pencil because I used them throughout my childhood; my mother was literally born in Ticonderoga, NY. However, the AmazonBasics are the best bang for your buck. Are they cute? Is your kid going to be inspired by the cool Frozen or Star Wars logo? No. Because this is a standard, BASIC pencil. They’re just yellow. But to be honest, those “cool looking” pencils always lack quality compared to something like this. The simplicity is what makes these pencils so great; they’re just pencils. They know their function, and they get the job done. These are definitely going to be my “good” pencils from now on, especially to give out to kids who really are responsible with their supplies.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2016",neutral

However, one downside I noticed is that the eraser does not work effectively. It tends to smudge and leave faint traces behind when erasing. While it's not a deal-breaker for me, I do wish the eraser was more efficient.

• Nice, sleek design
• Keys feel nice to type on (for membrane keys anyway) as in they have a pleasant feedback and the keys’ surface is pleasantly soft to the touch
• The RGB backlighting can get super bright, which I am not used to. I like the option to change it. I’m not used to that option for a keyboard.
• Worked right away with Windows 10 without Razer software
• The cable routing option underneath the keyboard was an unexpected surprise. Nice touch Razer!

Cons:

• You apparently need the Razer Synapse software to change the RGB lighting, among other things.
• That space bar is much louder compared to all the other keys, and you most definitely will notice it. (Very loud for a membrane keyboard anyway.)
• The keys are a bit tough to see without any lighting on, but not too bad. (I am just used to the Logitech K120 keyboard’s highly visible keys.)
• The lack of dedicated media buttons, but I knew that before purchase.
• The Synapse software is fascinating, yet quite slow. It’s still interesting to use, but not a positive in my book for a keyboard. (Try the Synapse Beta software instead, as it seemed more responsive.)

Main review:

I am coming from using a typical, no-frills, cheap keyboard called the Logitech K120 that is quite popular and I have had no issues with. I just wanted to try something…new.

This is my first gaming keyboard I tried since getting a Saitek Eclipse (series 1) with membrane keys back in 2008. I loved that Eclipse keyboard. I never had a gaming keyboard before that, and I just plugged the USB cable into my new desktop PC at the time and it worked. The Saitek Eclipse had dedicated/separate volume buttons and backlighting button on it other than using the function keys or something. The keys felt great and it never let me down for many years before I sold it for some reason. Also, I don’t recall needing to have downloaded some software unlike this Razer one to get the backlighting to work. No it didn’t have RGB lighting, but a keyboard with backlighting was amazing to me for a new desktop PC. Sure, this Razer keyboard works without downloading Razer’s Synapse software, but I wish there was a way to change the backlight color without it. That’s my main gripe about this Razer keyboard. I still haven’t tried the highly touted mechanical keyboards that I have been reading about for eons, but I have loved membrane keyboards so much that I haven’t felt the need to try mechanical yet. I may change my mind soon.

This keyboard evokes a bit of the same feeling as that keyboard, although this Razer keyboard of course doesn’t have dedicate media buttons. Do I need those dedicated media buttons? Not really…but they sure came in handy and I knew where they were and were easily accessible on the keyboard.

So, what I did after trying this Razer keyboard for a couple days is order a full-size Corsair K55 RGB gaming membrane keyboard with dedicated media buttons as well to see which one I respond to better.

Overall, I think you will enjoy this gaming keyboard (for the price) if you have modest expectations and don’t require lots of features as on many other, more expensive gaming keyboards that I have read about before opting for this one.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2024",neutral

Featuring a new ultra-slim form factor, more durable keycaps, and Razer Chroma™ RGB, it is the perfect introduction to our unfair advantage.",Video Games,4.4,"Within two months the keycap faces begun to significantly erode. The keys themselves break off from the keyboard because of how they designed the new keys versus the Ornata V2 which I have had for well over 2 years. Luckily the Ornata V2 keys fit in this keyboard because Razer not only does not cover anything dealing with the keycaps in the warranty for literally breaking off the board. I have swapped well over 10+ keys from my Ornata V2 to this Ornata V3 and they reason they break is because the cap has two prongs that fit into a square bracket then that square bracket is pressed into where the key needs to go and those two little prongs on the cap just shear or break very easily and on the Ornata V2 it is just one part instead of two as in it is just the square bracket which is tightly affixed to the cap with no prongs at all.

Razer support was able to do nothing for me and trust me I really tried and hounded them over this. A keyboard shouldn't lose functionality over 2 months (if I didn't have the Ornata V2 keys I would be sunk as I can't afford a 20$ keyboard right now). I even tried to see if they would sell replacement keycaps as how expensive could they be, but they do not sell or provide replacements at all, so if you have one key go you are done.

Anyway I am moving onto Corsair after being with Razer since 2009 or even earlier. I don't know if Corsair is any better with their support or quality of keyboards, but after this happening with Razer and getting not even a small amount of help with this catastrophic manufacturing issue I am willing to give my money to any other company.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2023",neutral

Already, there are 5 letters that have faded (the black paint has worn off) and are no longer readable with 12 other keys well on their way to having the letter worn away.
This is not a cheap keyboard, by any means, and I highly expected the finish to last *MUCH* longer than it did, but the keys are only painted black with negative space to shape the letters, making constant use wear the paint away and expose a clear/see through key.

I have purchased 3 times, in 3 different size varieties. I am a Sales and Event Manager in a fine dining, high volume restaurant. The majority of my day is spent in front of my computer but multiple times a week, I’m running through our kitchen or pushing and shoving tables and chairs around to see if a specific setup can work. I’ve been wearing these since 2022. They look classy as hell and I feel like they’re good to my feet, my feet don’t hurt, nor does my bunion or high arches. I am a 8-8.5. Recently my podiatrist told me due to my bunion (thanks high heel from early 2000’s!) I should not be wearing any shoe with a narrow toe box. Here’s my take on the sizes I’ve owned in this specific shoe:
Bought in 2021, size 8 regular: Fit great, a tad snug at first but caused no discomfort. They actually stretched out within a few days. And needed up fitting perfectly and were some comfy, classy ass kickers. This pair was awesome for a year. Was time to replace
Bought in 2022, size 9 regular: Figured the 8 was a tad snug, and the size 9 was on sale about $20 cheaper, and recovering financially from the pandemic and I said yup $20 cheaper let go and pulled the trigger. They were fine, weren’t tight at all like my first pair, but felt sloppy on me/to me like I looked like Ronald McDonald. All good still wore them, still have them as a back up. No doubt of comfort, just really comfortable shoes.
Bought in 2023, size 8 wide: This was/ is a really wide shoe. Weird because I feel like everyone that’s reviewed says not wide enough. It is plenty wide for me. Too wide, enough so that the shoe just fits weird and loose. Won’t return, just another back up. I can wear them but feel like my feet look dumpy.
I just ordered a size 8 regular again today. If they’re a tad tight, I’ll pop on my shoe stretcher as I know these are stretchable.
I wear these 5 days a week, and only need to replace them once a year. Yes, please! They’re comfortable, stylish and can match almost any business casual outfit… I have put these shoes through physical situations and my feet always feel comfortable coming out on top. Wish the sole was a bit more durable, but for the weight ( actually weightlessness) of this shoe and the comfort, I’m more than happy to purchase over and over. The key is to finding the right size and width for you…. They’re my go to ass kickers whether in a suit, dress or slacks!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2024",neutral

Week 1: haven’t seen much of a difference with my dark spots but my skin has gotten softer and smoother. I only use them 2 times as a fade mask (for 15 mins or until they dry out) but my skin feels more hydrated and super soft.

Month update: They do work! They have got rid of most of my post acne dark spots. The stubborn ones from many years ago have faded significantly. Before the dark spots were too dark to cover with full coverage concealer. Now i can easily cover them with concealer.

We witness Xavier's journey in establishing his nightclub business, which intertwines with beloved characters from all three of Ana's series.

"King of Sloth (Kings of Sin, 4)",9,In Stock,by Ana Huang (Author),,Books,4.2,"Sloane Kingston, the savvy publicist for Javier Castillo, helps him transform his lifestyle in order to claim his billionaire inheritance. As their time together increases, they begin to unravel each other's layers, finding that there's more to them than what the world perceives.

✨Thoughts✨
I was already invested in the characters, so it was a no-brainer to pick up this novel. Personally, I opted for the audiobook version, which was a great listening experience.

From the very beginning of this series, Sloane Kingston's character caught my attention. In this installment, we are given a deeper glimpse into Sloane's past and her background. Meanwhile, Javier emerges as a fun character with intriguing layers. In contrast to previous books, the tone of this novel comes across a bit flat.

The connection between Sloane and Javier simmers gradually, and I find this aspect of the story satisfying. An additional treat is the reappearance of beloved characters from previous books and the introduction of new ones who are sure to make a comeback with their own stories.

🎧 This is a duet narration by the talented duo of Andi Arndt and Gregory Salinas. As a Spanish speaker, I couldn't help but notice occasional lapses in the fluency of Javier's Spanish, which slightly detracted from the authenticity of his character. However, the superb narration quickly squashes any minor distractions. Overall, if you're already invested in this series, you absolutely cannot afford to skip this fourth installment.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024",positive
"King of Sloth (Kings of Sin, 4)",9,In Stock,by Ana Huang (Author),,Books,4.2,"Closer to 3.5 -3.75

I have been a fan of Ana Huang's writing since Twisted Love. I find that her stories are fairly easy to get into and contain the right amount of romance and spice. While you can read each book independently from the others, I would still highly recommend reading the books in the recommended reading order. You will find that each subsequent book will have minor easter eggs from prior books.

Personally, I was incredibly excited to read King of Sloth because I was and still am a big Sloane fan. Sloane is a high-powered, self-made woman whose main priorities are her friends, her youngest sister, and her work. As someone who tends to fixate on work and has the tendency to suppress my emotions - I related to Sloane so much and I was rooting for her throughout the book. I also admired Xavier's growth throughout the series and appreciated that he not only managed to mature from his party boy days, but he did it in a way that was still true to himself.

While I did ultimately enjoy King of Sloth I had a hard time getting through the first 30% -40% of the book. I think one of the main issues was that after reading so many books by Ana Huang and becoming accustomed to the writing style, the changes in this book took some adjusting. Dialog between the characters was different from how her books were previously different, as well as the switching between POV's.

Despite some of the issues within the book I believe that Sloane's and Xavier's story is a great addition to the King of Sin series and worth checking out!",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024",positive
"King of Sloth (Kings of Sin, 4)",9,In Stock,by Ana Huang (Author),,Books,4.2,"All I have to say is Ana Huang just never misses. For me it’s a guaranteed 5 star banger. And King of Sloth is no exception! I absolutely loved Xavier and Sloane!

Xavier Castillo is a billionaire playboy heir who never wanted anyone enough to chase them...until he met her. Sloane Kensington is a high powered publicist who is used to dealing with difficult clients. The one client who infuriates her the most? Xavier with his stupid dimples and laid back attitude. But what happens when Xavier’s future becomes uncertain and the person who is responsible for his inheritance is the one person who is immune to his charm? Or is she?

📚 Book Tropes:
- Billionaire Romance
- Publicist x Client
- Opposites Attract
- Golden Retriever x Black Cat
- He Falls First and Hard
- Forced Proximity

💭 My Thoughts: listen if Ana Huang writes it, best believe your girl is going to read it! And per usual she hit it out of the park with King of Sloth! I absolutely loved Sloane and Xavier! There is so much to these two beyond the surface. I don’t know if I would have picked a better match for either one of them. They are such opposites but they bring the best out in each other. Sloane needed someone to loosen her up and thaw out her hard exterior and Xavier was that for her. Xavier needed someone to light a fire up his butt so he could tap into his potential and Sloane challenged him will providing the support he needed.

So did Sloane and Xavier’s story live up to my hopes, yes it did! I loved the plot, character development and the spice. Like I say, Ana can do no wrong in my eyes!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2024",positive

It was the perfect length to really give us a good look at their whole story and also how they grew together as a couple! The bonus scene is adorable!
